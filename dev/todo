- [ ] saving
 - [ ] get table order from table to be saved
 - [ ] set table order from saved
  -- maybe use reactive vals for these

- [ ] resetting selection resets whole plot (e.g. order and filtering)
 -- can we preserve these too programatically?

feedback

- [ ] Login page works well - could do with some instructions or quick context to suggest you can create an account at that window; seems like you already need an account at current

- [ ] Comparison tool is great. Could be quite beneficial if you could pull the players next five fixtures or so and use the FDR maybe...

- [ ] Advanced stats would be ideal - maybe even if there's a prediction model you could pull from... fplform maybe... idk whether that's allowed or not though

- [ ] Draft rank - drag feature really nice, would be cool to have a way to type number in so not dragging all the way up the screen or down

- [ ] Ability to have specific position watchlists would be good

- [ ] Can't see text when typing in filters (can see something has been entered by the (x) but no text to say what's been typed

- [x] Would be nice to be able to reset/deselect all in comparison - have to scroll all the way through to deselect individually

- [x] Issue where you select more than 9+ players in the list to compare but only 8 display on the comparison field despite showing 9+ selected
-- [ ] documentation around this?

- [x] Pages and entry limiter would be ideal to prevent big long list/having to scroll far down (seems like it's something already considered)

- [x] Refresh and re-login works great
